### v3.0.0

[2020.07.20; Maikuolan] First stable release for the phpMussel v3 Core.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Prior to phpMussel v3, the "phpMussel Core", "phpMussel CLI-mode", "phpMussel Front-End", and "phpMussel Uploads Handler" ("phpMussel Web") were all bundled together as a single repository (phpMussel/phpMussel). Since phpMussel v3, these each all have their own, separate repositories. I've opted to start releases at this repository (phpMussel/Core) at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with previous versions of the "phpMussel Core" which exist outside this repository.

### v3.0.1

[2020.07.31; Maikuolan]: Improved the way that the (generated by ...) notice, displayed at the footer of HTML pages, is rendered.

[2020.08.05; Maikuolan]: Addressed a potential compatibility problem with some specific kinds of symlinked installations.

[2020.10.01; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Discovered that the image chameleon attack detection could generate false positives against Mac OS X thumbnails; Fixed. *Refer [#223](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/223).*

### v3.0.2

[2020.10.01; Bug-fix; v10mthibault]: Typo in Loader.php; Trying to call function sprint instead of sprintf which leads to an error; Fixed.

[2020.10.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Wrong number of files reported when recursively scanning through directories; Fixed. *Refer [#225](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/225).*
